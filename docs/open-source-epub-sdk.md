# Open Source EPUB SDK

An open source EPUB SDK helps you build a reader with reflowable text, navigation, and theming while keeping control of your UX and roadmap. EPUB support is essential when you ship long-form or book-style content.

## What to look for in an EPUB SDK

- Reflowable layout with good typography and spacing controls
- Table of contents and chapter navigation
- Search, selection, and highlights
- Theming (light, dark, sepia) for reading comfort

## Where Papyrus fits

Papyrus supports EPUB alongside PDF and TXT, using the same core state and UI patterns. On mobile, EPUB content renders in a WebView while keeping the same reader experience.

Key points:

- Open source EPUB SDK with MIT license
- Unified state and events for annotations and search
- Shared UX across formats (PDF, EPUB, TXT)
- React and React Native UI layers for web and mobile

## Evaluation checklist

- EPUB rendering quality and navigation
- Search and highlight fidelity
- WebView or native integration strategy
- Theming and typography controls
- Active documentation and examples
