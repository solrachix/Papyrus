# Papyrus vs PDFTron (Apryse)

Teams searching for "PDFTron alternative" or "open source PDFTron alternative" typically want a PDF SDK with annotations and viewer UI, but without enterprise licensing. Papyrus is an open source option focused on document reading workflows for web and mobile.

## Why teams look for a PDFTron alternative

- Multi-format support: EPUB and TXT can matter for reading products.

## What Papyrus provides

- Engine-agnostic core (PDF.js on web; native bridge on mobile).
- UI kits for React and React Native (viewer, sidebars, topbar).
- Annotations, text selection, search, and lifecycle events.
- Theming and configuration for brand-aligned UX.
- Support for PDF, EPUB, and TXT in one SDK.
