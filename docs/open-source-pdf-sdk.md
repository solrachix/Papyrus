# Open Source PDF SDK

An open source PDF SDK gives you the building blocks to render, search, and annotate PDF documents while keeping full control over UX, data, and roadmap. It is ideal for teams that need a reliable reader experience without vendor lock-in.

## What you get from a PDF SDK

- Rendering and text layer support for selection, highlights, and outlines.
- Reader UI components like toolbars, sidebars, and pagination.
- State and events for annotations, search, and navigation.
- Theming so the viewer matches your product.

## When to choose an open source PDF SDK

- You need to ship a custom reader UI with full ownership.
- Your product must support web and mobile with shared logic.
- You want to keep features like search and annotations in-house.

## How Papyrus fits

Papyrus is an open source PDF SDK with a shared core, pluggable engines, and UI kits for React and React Native. It focuses on real reader workflows: selection, search, highlights, and annotations.

Key points:

- MIT license with no usage caps.
- Engine-agnostic core (PDF.js on web, native on mobile).
- Ready-to-use UI components for web and mobile readers.
- Multi-format support (PDF, EPUB, TXT) if your roadmap needs it.
